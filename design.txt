Here is your updated and consolidated design specification in plain text format, without markdown, and with integrated improvements:

---

Grindy single-player offline RPG inspired by Hypixel Skyblock and RuneScape. Progression is driven by long-term goals: defeating enemies, skilling, crafting, and acquiring gear. Difficulty is determined by time commitment, not punishing mechanics.

Core Gameplay Loop:

* Choose a goal (e.g. craft item, reach level, defeat boss)
* Grind enemies or resources toward that goal
* Level up or craft improved tools, weapons, and gear
* Unlock new content: zones, enemies, recipes, pets

Progression Systems:

Skills and XP:

* Skills include Combat, Mining, Woodcutting, and Slayer (more TBD)
* Each skill tracks XP and level (1–60)
* Level-ups grant stat bonuses (e.g. +5 Defense per Mining level)
* Certain tools, nodes, and gear are gated by skill levels

Resource Mastery:

* Tracks total items gathered per resource type
* Mastery levels at thresholds (e.g. 10, 50, 100, 500...)
* Unlocks recipes, boosts drop yield, and grants stat bonuses

Beastiary:

* Tracks total kills per enemy type
* Tier levels at 1, 10, 50, 100, 1000, etc.
* Grants passive damage bonuses against those enemies
* Maxing Beastiary entries is a deep endgame challenge
* Total Beastiary level (sum of all levels) grants global bonuses (e.g. +HP, Strength, Magic Find)

Zone Mastery:

* Tracks all content cleared in a zone: Beastiary entries, resource mastery, unique drops
* Unlocks zone-specific bonuses (e.g. +1% XP or drop rate)
* Maxing requires maxing all enemies and nodes within a zone

Collection Log:

* Tracks all items dropped or crafted
* Completion milestones grant Magic Find (e.g. +1 at 10 items, +2 at 100, etc.)

Slayer System:

* Tasks are assigned by Slayer Master NPCs (e.g. “Kill 30 Cave Slimes”)
* Slayer XP and levels unlock harder tasks, new zones, and unique Slayer gear
* Bonus rewards (e.g. XP or drop multipliers) while on-task

Skill Contracts / Job Board:

* Random daily or weekly contracts: “Mine 100 Iron Ore”, “Defeat 10 enemies without getting hit”
* Rewards include gold, enchantment materials, temporary buffs
* Scales with total skill level or mastery

Item Systems:

Item Types:

* Weapons (swords, staves, bows)
* Tools (pickaxes, axes, etc.)
* Armour (body, head, legs)
* Accessories (rings, amulets)

Stats and Scaling:

* Power comes from stat bonuses on gear and level-ups
* Generic items roll stat ranges (e.g. Iron Sword: 10–12 damage)
* Unique items drop with fixed stats (e.g. Dustfang)
* Items can be Ancient (50% boosted stats) or Enchanted (prefix/suffix buffs)
* Use-based upgrades (e.g. kill-count scaling) evolve weapons
* Multiple items from the same set grant bonuses

Item Enchantments:

* Enchantments applied via drops or crafting (e.g. Spicy = +Crit Damage)
* Buffs can be applied permanently using enhancement items
* Buffs stored in item data and shown in tooltips
* Stat bonuses increase dynamically with counters (e.g. +1 Strength at 100 kills)

Pet System:

* Pets drop from enemies or hatch from rare items
* Provide passive stat boosts (e.g. XP gain, magic find, auto-pickup)
* Some pets grant bonuses against specific mobs (e.g. Zombie Pet reduces zombie damage)
* Pets gain XP and can evolve using upgrade items (e.g. Zombie Catalyst)
* Pet collection log tracks discovery and evolution

Combat System:

* Attack require left-click
* Semi-idle: player dodges and positions, with aimable area.
* Attack types: Melee (swords), Magic (AOEs), Ranged (projectiles)
* Advanced weapons unlock multi-hit, AOE, and projectile spread
* Enemies use contact damage and AOE patterns
* Bosses have arenas, rare drops, unique behaviours
* Mutated mobs add variety (e.g. Exploding, Fast, Poisonous)
* Mutation chance increases with Beastiary level

Death:

* Non-punishing: player respawns at last safe zone
* Safe zones marked by a zone flag; entering one updates player’s respawn location
* Gold loss on death is under consideration

Tools and Gathering:

* Tools inflict HP on nodes; nodes give partial rewards per hit
* Final hit awards bonus XP and full drop table
* Tool stats:
  * Damage: how much HP per hit
  * Speed: cooldown reduction
  * Breaking Power: restricts access to higher-tier nodes

User Interface and Quality of Life:

* Hotbar: equip and switch tools/weapons
* Skill UI: XP bars with level and stat tooltips
* Tooltip system: dynamic info on hover (items, skills, resources, etc.)
* Zones show discovery messages
* Damage, XP, and level-up popups
* Alt-key shows stat ranges on tooltips
* Tooltips show permanent buffs, current upgrade progress, and counters
* UI pane shows pickup log, skill XP bars, gold, and current action

World and Zones:

* Each zone has enemies, nodes, portals, and size info
* Safe zones serve as respawn hubs
* Thematic connections (e.g. Forest → Clearing → Hollow)
* Zones can have requirements (e.g. Mining 10)
* Layouts are square; future zones may use rooms/corridors (procedural or hand-designed)
* Mining nodes spawn in clusters
* Boss zones support cutscene-like intros
* Shrines may appear that offer temporary buffs to the player

Zone Modifiers:

* Rotating zone effects: e.g. +50% drop chance for silk, enemies move faster but drop more XP
* Player can re-roll zone modifiers with consumables
* Rare cursed portals spawn harder alternate versions of existing zones

Economic Systems:

* Gold has no function yet
* Proposed sinks:

  * Crafting and enchantment costs
  * Contract re-rolls or cosmetic upgrades

Endgame and Replayability:

* Intended for long-term engagement
* Maxing everything is optional and time-intensive
* Late-game goals:

  * Level 60 in all skills
  * Full Beastiary and Collection Log
  * Maxing unique gear
  * Reaching the top of Hellish Tower (Combat 55+)
  * Slayer grind to highest tier
  * Perfect zone mastery
